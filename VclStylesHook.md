DateTime Controls

The Styling of the TMonthCalendar and TDatetimepicker components is one of the limitations of the VCL Styles, because such components are owner-draw by the system and doesnâ€™t allow to customize the look and feel when the native themes are enabled also only the newest versions of Delphi includes a partial styling support for such components. The Vcl.Styles.Hooks add styling support for these controls.
